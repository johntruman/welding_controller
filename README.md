4. Press knob to stop.

<h3>Emergency Switch</h3>
A connector is provided for an optional emergancy stop switch. When pressed, the system will instantly halt all actions. 

<h3>Limit switches</h3>
It's a good idea to have limit switches to stop the servo from running when the carriage has reached either end of the rail.

<h3>Changing the direction of travel</h3>
If the direction of travel is the opposite of what is on the LCD, it can be changed easily.
Flip the SW5 switch on the servo driver.
